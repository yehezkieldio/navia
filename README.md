## Navia

Navia is here as yet another multipurpose Discord bot, there's already a lot of them - but why not more? Built with TypeScript and utilizes the [Sapphire](https://www.sapphirejs.com/) framework.

> Navia is currently a side-hobby project of mine. I'm working on it in my free time or when I'm bored, so it's not a priority. I'm also using it as a way to learn new things, so it's a bit of a mess. I'm trying to keep it as clean as possible, but it's still a mess.
